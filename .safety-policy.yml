            # PVE-2022-51668, sqlalchemy str(engine.URL()) can leak password.
            reason: >-
              Our own code does not currently trigger any leaks.
              We *should* fix the issue, but there is no stable release of
              sqlalchemy 2 at time of writing.
              See RHELDST-15252.
